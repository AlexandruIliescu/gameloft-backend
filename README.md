# Spring Boot News Scraper Application

## Project Description
This Spring Boot application is designed to scrape news and video feeds every 10 minutes and manage the data persistence in a database. It also ensures the creation of local backups for each feed content on every run and appropriately logs any exceptions that occur during the process.

### Key Functionalities
- **Data Scraping**: Automatically scrapes news feeds at regular intervals.
- **Data Storage**: Aggregates and stores essential information from each feed item such as title, description, thumbnail, link, and publish date in the database.
- **Local Backups**: Creates backups of each feed content locally every time the scraper runs.
- **Data Management**: Adds new feed items to the database and deletes those that are no longer available on the source website.
- **API Delivery**: Provides backend APIs that deliver the content of the current news and video tables according to the frontendâ€™s requirements.

### Feed Item Details
Each feed item stored in the database will contain the following information:
- Title
- Description
- Thumbnail
- Link
- Publish Date

### Scheduled Operations
The scraper performs the following operations on each run:
- Adds newly published feed items to the database.
- Deletes articles that are no longer present on the Eurogamer website.
